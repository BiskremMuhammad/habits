# Eisenberg Habit App

#### Background

Time is the most valuable asset anyone has, but we don’t protect, track or guard it as much as we protect and guard physical assets. Studies by neurobiologists, cognitive psychologists, and others indicate that 70-95% of ALL human behavior - fall into the habit category.

The goal of this app is to help people create, maintain, track healthy daily habits through behavioral design and the latest in choice architecture and habit research. Focusing on a system/identity-based approach of habit formation vs. a typical goal/outcome focused approach. The goal is to help people do the things they already want to do, but for lack of a well-designed process/system, don’t do.

### Development

This is the React-Native Project, we're using `expo` sdk for building & deploying the app.

**Branches**

`main` **branch**: is the Ready to deploy branch, and it's prohibited to directly push changes to this branch.

`dev` **branch**: is the Development reference branch, so always pull from _or_ pull-request to this one

for every new feature, a new branch should be created and sourced out from `dev` branch.

**running locally**

simply by running this command (typically after installing all dependancies `npm install`)

```
npm start
```
